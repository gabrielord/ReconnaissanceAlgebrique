### Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust automated system capable of accurately correcting mathematical expressions provided by students, taking into account the inherent variability and complexity of student responses.

## Challenges in Automated Grading of Mathematics

- **Recognition of Equivalent Expressions:** Mathematical expressions can vary in notation, such as different bracket arrangements, making it challenging for AI systems to recognize them as identical.

- **Impact of Variability:** Randomly generated math problems increase the difficulty for automated systems to consistently detect errors and verify correctness due to diverse expression forms.

- **Need for Sophisticated Algorithms:** Effective automated grading requires algorithms that understand mathematical principles, not just symbol comparison.

- **Adaptability:** As problem complexity ranges from basic arithmetic to advanced calculus, the AI system must adapt to handle diverse solutions and student variability accurately.
Sure, hereâ€™s an additional section for your README that outlines the structure and components of your project:

## Project Components

This project is divided into three main parts, each addressing different aspects of automated grading for mathematical expressions:

- **Web Development:**
  - We have developed a user-friendly website that allows students to interact directly with the grading system, submitting their mathematical expressions for evaluation.

- **Graphical Solution:**
  - The Zhang and Shasha algorithm is utilized to manage and assess the structural similarities between tree representations of mathematical expressions, aiding in the recognition of different but equivalent expressions.

- **Neural Network Solution:**
  - We are experimenting with Siamese networks to enhance the ability of our AI to accurately identify and verify the equivalence of complex mathematical expressions despite variations in their presentation.
