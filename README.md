## Challenges in Automated Grading of Mathematics

- **Recognition of Equivalent Expressions:** Mathematical expressions can vary in notation, such as different bracket arrangements, making it challenging for AI systems to recognize them as identical.

- **Impact of Variability:** Randomly generated math problems increase the difficulty for automated systems to consistently detect errors and verify correctness due to diverse expression forms.

- **Need for Sophisticated Algorithms:** Effective automated grading requires algorithms that understand mathematical principles, not just symbol comparison.

- **Adaptability:** As problem complexity ranges from basic arithmetic to advanced calculus, the AI system must adapt to handle diverse solutions and student variability accurately.
